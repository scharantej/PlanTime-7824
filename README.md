### HTML Files

1. **index.html** (*Homepage*): This file will serve as the landing page for the application. It will include the necessary HTML elements to allow the user to interact with the application, such as input fields, buttons, and a result display area.

### Routes

1. **home()**: This route will render the *index.html* page, which is the homepage of the application.

2. **generate_planner()**: This route will receive the user's input (tasks, time slots, etc.) via an HTTP request (typically a POST request) and process them to generate a personalized planner using Flask's logic and algorithms. It will then display the generated planner to the user.
